# Prediction-of-the-Prices-of-Houses
In this project, we will build a model to predict the price of Houses in Ames.

The project will be divided into 5 notebooks, to facilitate the comprehension:

0. *Overview and state-of-the-art*
1. *Loading and exploration of the data*. In this step, we are going to load the data and inspect it.
2. *Exploratory data analysis (EDA)*. It consists of making a deep analysis of the different variables that can help and influence the prediction. In this step will be also "clean" the dat or eliminate everything that is not important and/or contains errors.
3. *Model building*. With the data "clean" and ordered, it is time to build your mathematical model and make the first predictions.
4. *Conclusions*

Additionally, there is an **Appendix Notebook** in which you will be able to find complementary information to tackle  problems or issues that are not described in all working notebooks.
