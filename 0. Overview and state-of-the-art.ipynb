    "*AmesHouse Real State* is a real estate company located in Ames (USA) which has a team of professionals interested in improving their business model. For now, they use classic market analysis methods using different factors to try to predict the price of the housing market in their area. Their analysis methods are complete, but they have the impression that they are missing some variable.\n",

    "Several steps will be followed to tackle this problem, but it is important to spend some time on **understanding the client and its problem**. The first thing you have to do before you solve a problem is to define exactly what it is. You need to be able to translate data questions into something actionable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The real estate business is the sale of houses, and usually predictions are made of the number of houses to sell per fiscal year. This number of sales is translated into economic amounts and is included as a budget for the fiscal year. Therefore, it is important that the prediction of the price of a home is as close as possible to the \"future\" reality in order to minimize losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, AmesHouse wants to take advantage of the features that most impact and influence the price of the house. They normally want to buy a house at a low price and invest in the features that will give them the best return. For example, buying a house in a a normal location, but with future potential of the location. \n",
    "\n",
    "Having said that, now we understand why they want to make some price predictions of future houses in the area. So let's define some steps to follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Loading and exploration of the data*. In this step, we are going to load the data and inspect it. \n",
    "2. *Exploratory data analysis (EDA)*. It consists of making a deep analysis of the different variables that can help and influence the prediction. In this step will be also \"clean\" the dat or eliminate everything that is not important and/or contains errors. \n",
    "4. *Model building*. With the data \"clean\" and ordered, it is time to build your mathematical model and make the first predictions.\n",
    "5. *Conclusions*\n",
    "\n",
    "For a better understanding and in order not to extent so much the different Notebooks, each of the different steps are stored independently. You can find them in separate notebooks."

    "**Python** is one of the most popular programming languages today despite being a relatively old language.
